## Design and Color Scheme

#### Color Scheme: Cool and Calming Palette
The design uses a color palette with a calm, professional aesthetic:
   - **Deep Blue (#264653)**: Primary background color, used for the navbar and footer.
   - **Golden Yellow (#E9C46A)**: Accents for buttons, highlights, and icons.
   - **Teal (#2A9D8F)**: Used in active elements, such as hovering over icons or navigation links.
   - **Muted Orange (#F4A261)**: Accent color for alerts, buttons, and notifications.
   - **Light Background (#f8f8f8)**: Main background for content, creating a clean and modern look.

#### Layout and Typography
   - **Font**: The primary font is *DM Sans*, chosen for its readability and modern appearance.
   - **Grid System**: The app uses Bootstrap's grid system for a responsive layout that scales well across devices.
   - **Images**: High-quality product images are used for each product entry, with placeholders for products without images.

---

### Technologies Used

The following technologies are used to build and deploy the project:

#### Frontend
   - **React**: Frontend framework for a modular, interactive UI.
   - **React Bootstrap**: Used for responsive layout and pre-styled components.
   - **Axios**: For handling API requests between the frontend and backend.
   - **FontAwesome**: Provides icons for actions like editing, deleting, and navigating.

#### Backend
   - **Django & Django REST Framework**: RESTful backend, providing secure and structured data handling.
   - **Django CORS Headers**: Manages Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) for secure requests between the frontend and backend.
   - **dj-rest-auth**: Simplifies authentication processes, including login, registration, and token management.
   - **django-allauth**: Provides robust authentication solutions, supporting features like social login.
   - **django-filter**: Simplifies filtering functionality in Django REST Framework views, making it easier to search and filter data.
   - **djangorestframework-simplejwt**: JWT-based authentication system used for secure, stateless authentication between the client and server.
   - **dj-database-url**: Simplifies database configuration, particularly useful for managing environment-specific databases (like Herokuâ€™s Postgres).
   - **PostgreSQL**: Database for storing product, user, and comment data.
   - **Cloudinary**: Cloud storage service used to store and retrieve media files like product images.

#### Deployment
   - **Heroku**: Used for deploying both the Django backend and React frontend.
   - **Gunicorn**: WSGI HTTP Server for running the Django application in production, providing high performance for handling requests.
   - **GitHub**: Version control and project management.

#### Additional Libraries (General Support)

2. **Automated Testing**
   - Basic unit tests for backend views and serializers in Django.
   - Tests cover product creation, editing, and permission handling to verify secure and correct behavior.
   - Continuous integration with GitHub Actions ensures that tests run automatically for each commit.

## Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

## Deployment on Heroku
To deploy the Product Comparison Site on Heroku, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites
- Ensure you have a Heroku account. Sign up at Heroku if you don't have one.
- Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- Django
- Cloudinary account (for image storage)

**Steps to Deploy**
- Login to Heroku:
- Create a new Heroku app:
- Add a PostgreSQL database to your app:

1. **Set up environment variables:**
- In your local project directory, create a .env file and add your environment variables (e.g., Database URL, Django secret key, Cloudinary URL). You also need to set them directly in Heroku when deploying.

```console
os.environ.setdefault("DATABASE_URL", "your-database-url")

os.environ.setdefault("DJANGO_SECRET_KEY", "your-secret-key")

os.environ.setdefault("CLOUDINARY_URL", "your-cloudinary-url")
```

2. **Prepare your project for Heroku deployment:**
- Create a Procfile in the root of your project:
- Create runtime.txt in the root of your project:

```console
web: gunicorn your_project_name.wsgi:application

python-you're.version
```

- Install all dependencies from requirements text

```console
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

- Update config vars in Heroku dashboard under settings in your Heroku app to use the environment variables of your project (e.g., Database URL, Django secret key, Cloudinary URL), excatly to match.
- The config vars to update in Heroku dashboard settings is DATABASE_URL, ALLOWED_HOSTS, CLIENT_ORIGIN, CSRF_TRUSTED_ORIGINS, DEBUG, DEV and SECRET_KEY. All of these are pointed correctly in the settings.py Django app so no changes needed there.

- Run npm run build in the frontend folder to remove existing static folder and move over new static folder everytime changes are made to the frontend
- Run collectstatic to ensure all static files, including those from your Django app and any third-party apps, are gathered correctly in the staticfiles directory

```console
cd frontend
npm run build; Remove-Item -Recurse -Force ../staticfiles/build; Move-Item -Path build -Destination ../staticfiles/

python manage.py collectstatic --noinput
```

3. **Initialize a Git repository if you haven't already:**

```console
git init
```

- Commit your changes:

```console
git add .
git commit -m "Prepare for Heroku deployment"
```

- In Heroku dashboard where you created your new app in the deploy tab conntect your github and then deploy your branch.
- Open your deployed app in the browser:

---

## Local Deployment

1. **Clone the repository:**

```console
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/product-comparison-site.git
cd product-comparison-site
```

2. **Install the Required Dependencies**

```console
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. **Set up enviorment variables**
- Create env.py file in the root of your project directory and update your enviorment variables (e.g., Database URL, Django secret key, Cloudinary URL)
- The enviorment variables to update in env.py file is DATABASE_URL, ALLOWED_HOSTS, CLIENT_ORIGIN, CSRF_TRUSTED_ORIGINS, DEBUG, DEV and SECRET_KEY. All of these are pointed correctly in the settings.py Django app so no changes needed there.

4. **Set up the database:**

```console
python manage.py makemigrations
python manage.py migrate
```

5. **Create a superuser:**

```console
python manage.py createsuperuser
```

6. **Run the development server:**
- Open up / split two terminals, one for Django and one for React

```console
python manage.py runserver

cd frontend
npm start
```

7. **Navigate to the project in your browser:**
- http://127.0.0.1:8000/ - Django app
- http://127.0.0.1:3000/ - React app
